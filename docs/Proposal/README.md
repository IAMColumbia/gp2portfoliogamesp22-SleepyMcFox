The game that I want to create is a 2D platformer fighter with elements of resource gathering and crafting. The goal is to have the fighting concept be fully fleshed out with the movement being the focus of the game, as that will impact both the fighting phase as well as the resource gathering phase 

For gameplay, there will be two phases to each round. The first phase will be the upgrade phase which happens both before the game starts and before the next round of the game starts. This is where the players will spend their resources to gain an advantage over their opponents. Afterwards they will be placed on the same map for the next phase where the players are under a timer to collect as many materials as possible, whoever collects the most materials, or the more high-quality materials wins the round. Whoever wins in the best of three format wins the game. During this round, the player has a limited inventory to take back with them to their respective camps, and the more that they take the slower their character will be depending on their weight class. While there is the option of gathering materials and taking them back to the camp, the opposing players will be able to attack them and attempt to steal their materials using varying methods such as trapping them or bringing their health down to zero and forcing them to retreat to their camp. 

 

I am confident in the movement of the characters as I have done many different instances of vector-based movement with acceleration and deceleration, where I believe that I will struggle is both in the balancing aspect of the game as well as how to have hit scan by frame of the animation, as I have never done animation trees before but have an idea on how I can implement this mechanic.
